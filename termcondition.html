					<p style="text-align:justify">General terms. The following Terms and Conditions (“Terms”) govern the Main Sale of
cryptographic tokens – Kolin Tokens (“Kolin”) – that are required to transact on the KOLIN PLATFORM ("Kolin platform") described in KOLIN WHITEPAPER (“Whitepaper”) to Users (“Users” collectively, and “User” individually). The
information contained in the "Whitepaper" and on Kolin website is
of descriptive nature only, are not binding and do not – unless explicitly referred to herein –
form part of the Terms or the agreement between the parties. By participating in the Main
Sale of "Kolin", the User expressly acknowledges and represents that he/she has carefully
reviewed the Terms and fully understand the risks, costs, and benefits of purchasing "Kolin"
and agrees to be bound by the Terms. As set forth below, the User further represents and
warrants that, to the extent permitted by law, he/she is authorized to purchase "Kolin" in
his/her relevant jurisdiction, is of a legal age to be bound by these Terms, and will not hold
Kolin, its parent and affiliates, and the officers, directors, agents, joint ventures,
employees and suppliers of Kolin or affiliates, now or in the future and any other
member of the Kolin Team liable for any losses or any special, incidental, or
consequential damages arising out of, or in any way connected to the Main Sale of "Kolin".
The user understands and accepts that while the individuals and entities, including
Kolin, assigned to this task will make reasonable efforts to develop and complete
the "Kolin platform" and KOLIN project, it is possible that such
development may fail and User’s "Kolin" may become useless and/or valueless due to
technical, commercial, regulatory or any other reasons. The User is aware of the risk that
even if all or parts of the Kolin platform are successfully developed and released in
full or in parts, due to a lack of public interest, the KOLIN project could be fully or
partially abandoned, remain commercially unsuccessful or shut down for lack of interest,
regulatory or other reasons. The User therefore understands and accepts that purchasing
"Kolin" carries significant financial, regulatory and/or reputational risks (including the
complete loss of value of purchased "Kolin", if any, and attributed features of the
Kolin project). This document does not constitute a prospectus of any sort, is not a
solicitation for investment and does not pertain in any way to an initial public offering or a
share/equity offering and does not pertain in any way to an offering of securities in any
jurisdiction. Only individuals, entities, or companies that have significant experience with
and understanding of the usage and intricacies of cryptographic tokens, like bitcoin (“BTC”),
and blockchain-based software systems should participate in the main sale of "Kolin". Users
should have functional understanding of storage and transmission mechanisms associated
with cryptographic tokens. While the KOLIN team will be available to assist Users
of "Kolin" during and after the token Sale, Kolin will not be responsible for lost
WAVES, any other Cryptocurrency or "Kolin" resulting from actions taken by, or committed by
Users. No Ownership, Revenue or Governance Rights User understands and accepts that
"Kolin" does not represent or constitute any ownership right or stake, share or security or
equivalent rights nor any right to receive future revenues, shares or any other form of
participation or governance right in or relating to the Kolin Project and/or "Kolin".
Ownership of "Kolin" carries no rights, express or implied, other than the right to participate
in the Kolin Project if and to the extent the Kolin project has been
successfully completed and launched. By receiving "Kolin", no form of partnership, joint
venture or any similar relationship between the Users and Kolin and/or other
individuals or entities involved with the setting up of the Kolin Project is created.
Main sale period : The public Main Sale of "Kolin" began on 02 July 2018 at 19:00
UTC. The Main Sale period will run for 24 weeks or when the total sale orders of "Kolin" placed reaches the value of 2 billion
Kolin, whichever condition is met sooner.<br><br>
Kolin reserves the right to extend the sale period for any reason, including the unavailability of the website https://kolinplatform.com
or other unforeseen security or procedural issues. Though it does not currently anticipate
doing so, Kolin also reserves the right to shorten the Main Sale period for any
reason with "Kolin" value and cap. The price will be set in WAVES for the Main sale period at incresing steps of
0.000002 WAVES for 1 "Kolin". KOLIN shall stop accepting new purchase orders of "Kolin"
once total sale orders of "Kolin" reaches 2 billion. However, the actual amount of "Kolin"
sold in the main sale may be different from the aforementioned value due to the fact that
transactions may clear or be canceled after the end of the Main Sale. Disclosure of
Transactions In the spirit of openness and to enable Users to have as much information as
possible to guide their decision making process, KOLIN will disclose in real time the
total number of "Kolin" sold in order to enable the User to develop an understanding of the
size of the existing "Kolin" pool at the time of submitting their "Kolin" purchase order. Sale
on Kolin website will maintain an interface, which can be used to purchase
"Kolin". The interface will be available at Waves DEX instructions for purchasing
"Kolin" using the interface will be embedded and available for review on the Kolinplatform
website during the Main Sale period. Failure to follow these instructions may limit, delay, or
prevent a User from purchasing "Kolin". Any questions about these instructions should be
directed to contact@kolinplatform.com. It is the responsibility of each User of "Kolin" to
determine if the User can legally purchase "Kolin" in the User’s jurisdiction. In "Kolin" any
taxes have to be paid on the purchase of "Kolin" in the jurisdiction where the User is located,

the User shall undertake to pay such taxes. Acceptance of the Terms and Representations and

Warranties of the User By placing a purchase order of "Kolin", the User: Consents and agrees
to the Terms; Represents and warrants that the User is legally permitted to purchase "Kolin"
in the User’s jurisdiction; Represents and warrants that the User is of a sufficient age to
legally purchase "Kolin" or has received permission from a legal guardian who has reviewed
and agreed to these Terms; Represents and warrants that the User will take sole responsibility
for any restrictions and risks associated with the purchase of "Kolin" as set forth below,
Represents and warrants that User is not purchasing "Kolin" for the purpose of speculative
investment; Represents and warrants that the User is purchasing "Kolin" for the use of the
"Kolin" platform, or to facilitate development, testing, deployment and operation of
applications using the Kolin Platform; Represents and warrants that the User has
an understanding of the usage and intricacies of cryptographic tokens; Represents and
warrants that the User is not a citizen or resident of a country, whose legislation conflicts
with the present allocation of "Kolin" and/or the Kolin project in general.
Kolin warrants that it will not acquire "Kolin" from any third party during the
period of the Token Sale of "Kolin". Kolin project execution : The User
understands and accepts that for the purpose of the development and execution of the
Kolin project, Kolin receives the full amount of funds transferred during
the Token Sale period. This amount covers expenses, charges and other costs that may arise
by Kolin and/or its subcontractors as part of the development and execution of the
Kolin Project. It remains at Kolin’s sole discretion to decide how to
allocate the funds in order to develop and execute the Kolin Project.
Kolin has the right to engage subcontractors to perform the entire or partial
development and execution of the Kolin Project. The scope of the development
work will be triggered by the amount of funds received during the Token Sale. The User
understands and accepts that the User may not have any expectation of influence over governance on the Kolin Project. <br><br>
The User understands and accepts that the
Kolin project will need to go through substantial development works as part of
which it may become the subject to significant conceptual, technical and commercial changes
before release. Kolin Platform: the Kolin Platform as well
as the smart contract has been programmed according to the current state of the art. However,
the User understands and accepts that smart contract technology is still in an early
development stage and its application is of experimental nature, which carries significant
operational, technological, financial, regulatory and reputational risks. Risks the purchase of
"Kolin" carries with it significant risk. Prior to purchasing "Kolin", the User should carefully
consider the below risks and, to the extent necessary, consult a lawyer, accountant, and/or tax
professionals prior to determining whether to purchase "Kolin". In particular, but not
concluding, the User understands the inherent risks listed hereinafter: Risk of software
weaknesses: The User understands and accepts that smart contract system concept; the
underlying software application and software platform (i.e. the Waves blockchain) is still
in an early development stage and unproven. Thus there is no warranty that the process of
creating and distributing "Kolin" will be uninterrupted or error-free and there is an inherent
risk that the software could contain weaknesses, vulnerabilities or bugs causing, inter alia, the
complete loss of funds and/or "Kolin". Regulatory risk: The User understands and accepts that
the blockchain technology allows new forms of interaction and that it is possible that certain
jurisdictions will apply existing regulations on or introduce new regulations addressing
blockchain technology based applications, which may be contrary to the current setup of the
smart contract system and Kolin Platform. This may, inter alia, result in substantial
modifications of the smart contract system and/or the Kolin Project, including its
termination and the loss of "Kolin" for the User. Risk of abandonment / lack of success: The
User understands and accepts that the creation of the "Kolin" and the development of the
Kolin Project may be abandoned for a number of reasons, including lack of interest
from the public, lack of funding, lack of commercial success or prospects (e.g. caused by
competing projects). The User therefore understands that there is no assurance that, even if
the Kolin Project is partially or fully developed and launched, the User will receive
any benefits through the "Kolin" held by him/her. Risk associated with other applications:
The User understands and accepts that the Kolin project may give rise to other
alternative projects, promoted by unaffiliated third parties, under which "Kolin" will have no
intrinsic value. Risk of Losing Access to Tokens Due to Loss of Private Key(s), Custodial
Error or your Error: A private key, or a combination of private keys, is necessary to control
and dispose of Tokens stored in your digital wallet or vault. Accordingly, loss of requisite
private key(s) associated with you digital wallet or vault storing Tokens will result in loss of
such Tokens. Moreover, any third party that gains access to such private key(s), including by
gaining access to login credentials of a hosted wallet service you use, may be able to
misappropriate your Tokens. Any errors or malfunctions caused by or otherwise related to the
digital wallet or vault you choose to receive and store Tokens, including your own failure to
properly maintain or use such digital wallet or vault, may also result in the loss of your
Tokens. Additionally, your failure to precisely follow the procedures set forth in for buying
and receiving tokens, including, for instance, if you provide an incorrect Token Receipt
Address. The User understands and accepts that, as with other cryptocurrencies, the
blockchain used for the smart contract system is susceptible to mining attacks, including but
not limited to double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks, “selfish-mining” attacks,
and race condition attacks. Any successful attacks present a risk to the smart contract system,
expected proper execution and sequencing of "Kolin" transactions, and expected proper
execution and sequencing of contract computations. Risk of incompatible Wallet service: The
User understands and accepts, that the wallet or wallet service provider used for purchasing<br><br>


"Kolin", has to be technically compatible with the "Kolin". Failure to assure this may have the
result that User will not gain access to his/her "Kolin". Risks related to Amendments:
Amendments to the Kolin Platform’s protocols and software, if accepted and
authorized by the Kolin Platform’s community, could adversely affect "Kolin". The
Kolin Platform governs the peer-to-peer interactions between computers connected
to the Kolin platform. To the extent that a significant majority of the Users on the
Kolin Platform install software upgrade(s), the Kolin Platform would be
subject to new protocols and software that may adversely affect "Kolin". If more than a
significant majority of the Users on the Kolin platform install such software
upgrade(s), the Kolin Platform could “fork.” A failure to properly monitor and
upgrade the protocol could damage the Kolin Platform and "Kolin". Risks related
to intellectual property rights claims: Intellectual property rights claims may adversely affect
the operation of the Kolin Platform. Third parties may assert intellectual property
claims relating to the holding and transfer of digital assets and their source code. Regardless
of the merit of any intellectual property or other legal action, any threatened action that
reduces confidence in the Kolin Platform’s long-term viability or the ability of
end-Users to hold and transfer "Kolin" may adversely affect the value of "Kolin".
Additionally, a meritorious intellectual property claim could prevent Kolin and/or
other end-Users from accessing the Kolin Platform or holding or transferring their
"Kolin". No Liability : The User bears the sole responsibility to determine if the purchase,
ownership or use of "Kolin", the potential appreciation or depreciation in the value of "Kolin"
over time (if any), the allocation of "Kolin" and/or any other action or transaction related to
the Kolin Project have tax implications for him/her. In "Kolin" of any tax
obligations, the User shall be under obligation to pay all and any applicable tax. By
purchasing, holding or using "Kolin" the User agrees not to hold any third party (including
developers, auditors, contractors or founders of "Kolin") liable for any tax liability associated
with or arising from the creation, ownership or use of "Kolin" or any other action or
transaction related to the Kolin Project. The User acknowledges and agrees that, to
the fullest extent permitted by any applicable law, the User will not hold any developers,
advisors, auditors contractors or founders of Kolin liable for any damages or injury
whatsoever caused by or related to the use of or the inability to use "Kolin" or the
Kolin Platform under any cause or action whatsoever of any kind in any
jurisdiction, including, without limitation, actions for breach of warranty, breach of contract
or tort (including negligence) and that developers, auditors, advisors, contractors or founders
of Kolin Project shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, exemplary
or consequential damages, including for loss of profits, goodwill or data, in any way
whatsoever arising out of the use of, or the inability to use of the Kolin Platform
and/or "Kolin".The User further specifically acknowledges that developers, advisors, auditors,
contractors or founders of the Kolin Project are not liable, and the User agrees not
to seek to hold them liable, for the conduct of third parties, including other creators of
"Kolin", and that the risk of purchasing, holding and using "Kolin" rests entirely with the
User. By purchasing, holding or using "Kolin", and to the extent permitted by law, the User
agrees not to hold any third party (including developers, auditors, advisors, contractors or
founders) liable for any regulatory implications or liability associated with or arising from the
purchase, ownership or use of "Kolin" or any other action or transaction related to the
Kolin Project. Privacy Although Kolin requires Users to provide an
email address and other information, Kolin will not publish any identifying
information related Users without the prior written consent of the User unless required to do
so under applicable law. Kolin may request Users from time to time to provide
additional information. The User undertakes to provide such information. Users may be contacted via email by KOLIN regarding purchase or delivery of "Kolin" and the use of the Kolin Platform. 

<br>Disclaimer of Warranties THE USER EXPRESSLY AGREES THAT THE USER IS PURCHASING "Kolin" AT THE USER’S SOLE RISK AND THAT "Kolin" IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF TITLE OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, MERCHANTABILITY OR
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE (EXCEPT ONLY TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW WITH ANY LEGALLY REQUIRED WARRANTY PERIOD TO THE SHORTER OF THIRTY DAYS FROM FIRST USE OR THE MINIMUM PERIOD REQUIRED). WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING,
NONE OF THE KOLIN PLATFORM PARTIES WARRANT THAT THE PROCESS OF PURCHASING "Kolin" WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE. <br>

Limitations Waiver of Liability THE USER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY ANY APPLICABLE LAW, THE DISCLAIMERS OF LIABILITY CONTAINED HEREIN APPLY TO ANY AND ALL DAMAGES OR INJURY WHATSOEVER CAUSED BY OR RELATED TO USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE "Kolin" OR THE KOLIN PLATFORM UNDER ANY CAUSE OR ACTION WHATSOEVER OF ANY KIND IN ANY JURISDICTION, INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, ACTIONS FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY, BREACH OF CONTRACT OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) AND THAT NONE OF THE KOLIN PARTIES SHALLBE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES,
INCLUDING FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL OR DATA, IN ANY WAY WHATSOEVER ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, OR PURCHASE OF, OR INABILITY TO PURCHASE, "Kolin". THE USER FURTHER SPECIFICALLY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT KOLIN PARTIES ARE NOT LIABLE FOR THE CONDUCT OF THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING OTHER USERS OF "Kolin", AND THAT THE RISK OF PURCHASING AND USING "Kolin" RESTS ENTIRELY WITH THE USER. TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER APPLICABLE LAWS, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL ANY OF THE KOLIN PLATFORM PARTIES BE LIABLE TO ANY USER FOR MORE THAN THE AMOUNT THE USER HAVE PAID TO KOLIN PLATFORM FOR THE PURCHASE OF "Kolin". SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES OR THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF DAMAGES. THEREFORE, SOME OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION AND ELSEWHERE IN THE TERMS MAY NOT APPLY TO A USER.
